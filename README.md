# joomla-update-server
Use Github as your Joomla update server! This example repository is part of [the blogpost](https://snoerendevelopment.com/blog/joomla/creating-a-joomla-update-server-with-github).
This specific copy was cloned from https://github.com/snoeren-development/joomla-update-server/tree/v1.0.0 as a way for me to test how to get the update server aspect of https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Creating_a_simple_module/Adding_Auto_Update working properly.
